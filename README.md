# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition

•Designed and implemented a sentiment analysis model using Bidirectional LSTM layers with embeddings, achieving enhanced understanding of contextual nuances in natural language data for emotion classification. 
•Constructed a Sequential model with multiple Bidirectional LSTM layers and embeddings, optimizing accuracy using the 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' loss and 'adam' optimizer for sentiment analysis tasks.
